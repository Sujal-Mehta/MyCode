STL -> Standard Template Library 
Library of what ? 
    -> Generic Classes and Functions 

Why use STL -> Reuse : Well Tested Components 

Comonents of STL -> Containers , Algorithms , Iterators 
    -> containers = object which stores data
    -> procedure to process data
    -> object which points to an element of a container 

containers                          
    -sequence containers -> Linear fashion (Vector , List , Dequeue , etc....)                            
    -associative containers -> Direct Access {Tree}(Set,Multiset,Map,Multimap , etc....)       
    -derived containers -> Real World Modelling (Stack , Queue , Priority-queue , etc....) 
        1.Sequence containers 
            Vector  -> Random Access = fast
                    -> Middle Insertion/Deletion = slow , Insertion/Deletion at the end = fast 
            List    -> Random Access = Slow
                    -> Middle Insertion/Deletion = fast , Insertion/Deletion at the end = fast
        2.Associative Containers    
                    -> All operation Fast Except Random Access
        3.Derived containers
                    ->Depends ->(Data Structure)
